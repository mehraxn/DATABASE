**Laboratories of medical organization**

You are requested to keep track of which laboratories are located in buildings owned by a medical research 
organization. Each building is characterized by a unique code, a name, address and geographical coordinates (latitude 
and longitude). Inside each building there are several laboratories. Each laboratory is identified by a unique number 
within the building and is characterized by the floor on which it is located, the telephone number (if available) and the 
list of available equipment (e.g. PC, freezer, etc.).
