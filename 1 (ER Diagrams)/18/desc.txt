A technology product store wants to memorize the price list. Each product is marked with a barcode, brand and 
model. The products are divided into different categories (cameras, smartphones, PCs). For smartphones, we know the 
screen resolution (in inches), the resolution of the front and rear cameras (in megapixels), the storage capacity (in GB) 
and the size of the RAM (in GB). PCs are characterized by the storage capacity (in GB), the size of the RAM (in GB), 
 the model of the graphics card. The price list keeps track of the prices at which each product was sold over time.
