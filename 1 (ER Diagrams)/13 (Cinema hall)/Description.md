**Cinema hall**

A cinema wants to keep track of film showings at various halls. The films are characterized by a title, the year of 
production, the director and the list of actors. The halls of the cinema are described by a number and by the maximum 
capacity. A film can be screened in several halls even at the same time, but only one film is shown in a hall at a given 
time.
