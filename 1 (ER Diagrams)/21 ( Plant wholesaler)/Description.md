You are requested to design a database for the management of the wholesale sale of plants, taking into account the 
following information: 

⚫️ Different species of plants are available for sale. For each species both the Latin name and the common name
are known, as well as a unique code through which the species is identified. For each species it is also known
whether it is typically  suited for indoor (apartment) or outdoors (garden) and whether it is an exotic species
or not. Plants can be non-flowering or flowering. In the case of flowering plant species, all the colors in which
the plant is available are known.


⚫️ Customers are identified by a customer code and can be both private customer and resellers. For each private
customer, the tax code, name and address of the person are known, while for each reseller the VAT number,
name and address are known.

⚫️ Suppliers are identified through a supplier code; for each supplier, the name, tax code and address are also
known. A supplier can supply different plant species. However, plants of the same species are always
purchased from the same supplier.

⚫️ We want to keep track of all purchases made by each customer. A purchase, made on a specific date, relates
to a certain quantity of plants belonging to a specific species.

⚫️ The price list keeps track of the prices assumed over time by each species of plants.
