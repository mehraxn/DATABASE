A rental business wants to keep track of the vehicles in its fleet. The vehicles available are cars, vans, bicycles, electric 
mopeds, and e-scooters. All vehicles are identified by an alphanumeric code and characterized by make and model. For 
motor vehicles (cars and vans), the license plate, engine capacity, number of seats and fuel supply (petrol, LPG, Diesel) 
are known. For vans, the maximum load capacity is also known. For electric vehicles (mopeds and e-scooters) the 
average battery life is known. Only for e-scooters the vehicle registration number is also known.
