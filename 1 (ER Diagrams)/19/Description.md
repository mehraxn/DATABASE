**Gaming platform**

A gaming platform wants to keep track of when its users play. Each video game is characterized by a
unique code, a title and a description. Platform users are described by email, password, name and
surname. Note that a user cannot play multiple video games at the same time. Finally, the level reached
in the game session is also saved.
