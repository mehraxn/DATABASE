# Comparison of Ternary and Binary Relationships in EER Diagrams

This document explains the differences between two Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) diagrams modeling relationships between `SUPPLIER`, `TOYS`, and `SHOPS`.

---

## Diagram 1: Ternary Relationship (Single SUPPLY Relationship)

### Entities:
- **SUPPLIER**:
  - Attributes: `CompanyName`, `VATNumber` (Key), `TelephoneNumber` (Optional)
- **TOYS**:
  - Attributes: `Name` (Key), `Manufacturer`, `ListPrice`
- **SHOPS**:
  - Attributes: `Name` (Key), Composite `Address` (Street, City, ZipCode, HouseNumber)

### Relationship:
- **SUPPLY** is a **ternary relationship** among SUPPLIER, TOYS, and SHOPS.
- Cardinality: (0,N) for each entity.

### Interpretation:
- Represents: `SUPPLY(SUPPLIER, TOY, SHOP)`
- Meaning: A specific **supplier** supplies a specific **toy** to a specific **shop**.

---

## Diagram 2: Two Binary Relationships (SUPPLY and DISTRIBUTE)

### Entities:
- Same as Diagram 1

### Relationships:
1. **SUPPLY** (Binary): Between **SUPPLIER** and **TOYS**
   - Cardinality: (0,N)
   - Meaning: Which toys a supplier provides.
2. **DISTRIBUTE** (Binary): Between **SUPPLIER** and **SHOPS**
   - Cardinality: (0,N)
   - Meaning: Which shops a supplier delivers to.

### Interpretation:
- Relationship context is separated:
  - SUPPLY: Supplier-Toy mapping
  - DISTRIBUTE: Supplier-Shop mapping
- Cannot directly infer which toy goes to which shop via which supplier.

## Key Differences: Ternary vs Binary

| Aspect | **Ternary (Diagram 1)** | **Binary (Diagram 2)** |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Structure | One 3-way relationship: `SUPPLY(Supplier, Toy, Shop)` | Two 2-way relationships: `SUPPLY(Supplier, Toy)` + `DISTRIBUTE(Supplier, Shop)` |
| Dependency | All 3 entities interdependent | Relationships are independent |
| Expressiveness | Can specify exactly which toy is sent to which shop by which supplier | Cannot express the full 3-way mapping |
| Data Integrity | Higher: well-defined composite relationship | Lower: potential inconsistency between supply and distribution |
| Use Case Suitability | Best for context-dependent 3-entity relations | Best when pairwise relations are enough |
| Flexibility | Less modular, more expressive | More modular, less expressive |
| Query Complexity | Easier for tri-entity queries | Requires joins and inferences |

## Example Scenario
- Supplier S1 supplies Toy T1
- Supplier S1 distributes to Shop A

### Diagram 2:
- No info about whether Toy T1 goes to Shop A

### Diagram 1:
- Direct info: S1 supplies T1 to Shop A

âœ… Clear and complete.

## Conclusion
- **Use Ternary Relationship (Diagram 1)** when the full context of all three entities is important.
- **Use Binary Relationships (Diagram 2)** when relationships between entity pairs are sufficient.
