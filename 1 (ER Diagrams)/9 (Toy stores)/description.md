**Toy stores**

A chain of toy stores wants to track the supply of different products in various stores. The toys are characterized by 
a name, the manufacturer and the list price. For shops, the name and address are known (street, house number, zip 
code, city). Each toy can be supplied to a shop by different suppliers. Each supplier is identified by the VAT number 
and characterized by the company name and the list of telephone numbers (if available). A vendor may distribute several 
toys to the same store and to different stores.
