## SQL `EXISTS` Command - Full Explanation

### 1. What is `EXISTS` in SQL?
`EXISTS` is a **logical operator** in SQL that checks for the **existence of rows** returned by a **subquery**.

- If the **subquery returns at least one row**, `EXISTS` evaluates to **TRUE**.
- If the **subquery returns no rows**, `EXISTS` evaluates to **FALSE**.

It is typically used in the `WHERE` clause or in `IF` conditions.

---

### 2. Basic Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1
FROM table1
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM table2
    WHERE table1.column2 = table2.column2
);
```
This returns all rows from `table1` **only if** there is **at least one matching row** in `table2`.

---

### 3. Behavior of `EXISTS`
- The subquery **doesn’t return data** to the main query. It returns only **TRUE or FALSE**.
- Once the subquery finds **even one matching row**, it **stops** and returns **TRUE**.

---

### 4. What if the `EXISTS` command is NOT nested?

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 5000
);
```

##### Explanation:
- This command will return either:
  - `TRUE` (1) if **at least one employee** has salary > 5000.
  - `FALSE` (0) if **no employee** meets that condition.

#### Output Format:
- The output will be **a single row** with a column like:
  ```
  EXISTS
  -------
  1      ← means TRUE
  ```
  or
  ```
  EXISTS
  -------
  0      ← means FALSE
  ```

> So even when `EXISTS` is **not nested**, it still works by evaluating a subquery and returning **1 (TRUE)** or **0 (FALSE)**.

### 5. Summary
| Aspect        | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| Purpose       | Tests if a subquery returns any rows |
| Returns       | Boolean (TRUE/1 or FALSE/0) |
| Used in       | Typically in `WHERE` clauses, but can also be used standalone |
| Not Nested?   | Yes, still valid — returns TRUE/FALSE as one row |
| Performance   | Fast, as it stops after finding one matching row |

---

### 6. Does `EXISTS` only come after `WHERE`?

**Mostly yes**, but not **only**. Here's the detailed explanation:

---

#### 6.1 Common usage: After `WHERE`
This is the **most typical** and intended usage.
```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM departments
    WHERE departments.manager_id = employees.id
);
```
- Here, `EXISTS` checks if a related row **exists** in another table.
- The outer `SELECT` includes only employees who **manage at least one department**.

---

#### 6.2 Can also be used in `SELECT` list directly
```sql
SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM employees
    WHERE salary > 5000
) AS high_salary_exists;
```
- This returns **one row**:
  ```
  high_salary_exists
  -------------------
  1     ← if at least one employee has salary > 5000
  ```
- In this case, `EXISTS` is **not after `WHERE`**—it's in the **SELECT** list.

---

#### 6.3 Can be used in `CASE` expressions
```sql
SELECT
  name,
  CASE
    WHEN EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM bonuses WHERE bonuses.employee_id = employees.id
    )
    THEN 'Bonus received'
    ELSE 'No bonus'
  END AS bonus_status
FROM employees;
```
- Here, `EXISTS` is used **inside a `CASE`**, again not directly after `WHERE`.

---

#### 6.4 Used in control flow in stored procedures
In stored procedures (e.g., in PL/pgSQL or T-SQL):
```sql
IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE active = false) THEN
   -- Do something
END IF;
```
- Here, it's used for **control flow**, not in a query `WHERE` clause.

---

### 7. Conclusion

|-------------------------|-------------------|
| `WHERE` clause          | ✅ Most common     |
| `SELECT` clause         | ✅ Yes             |
| `CASE` expressions      | ✅ Yes             |
